# Project Name

Proxmox Home Server and Lab

## Summary

Me and my sister are going to build a multipurpose home server and lab, which will be running Proxmox a type 1 hypervisor that runs on Debian Linux. We will be using it for home assistant and node-red, which I will use to create an app to integrate our garage door and front door locks to close when we leave the house, and fun things with the lights. We will also be using it as a home lab for prototyping and creating our own flavor of Linux as with Proxmox we won't have to replace the operating system on our laptop. Additionally, we are interested in cybersecurity so it will be an isolated environment for testing cryptography, forensics, bruteforce, cross site scripting, and etc. This will also be our first time building a computer ourselves.

## Plan

1. Build the computer, assemble the cpu and motherboard and ram, put the power supply in the case
2. Connect the power supply to the motherboard
3. Connect the storage to the motherboard
4. Install Proxmox 13
5. Setup Proxmox and make sure its connected to our network and accessible
6. Create VM's and CT's to run and test our custom linux as well as home assistant and node-red
7. Unlimited possibility

## Budget

Everything will be from amazon so shipping is free, and extra cost will be sponsored by our parents
